                The Trust will consider a range of factors including the service
                or item being funded, the number of beneficiaries, the
                importance of the grant to the applicant charity, the efficiency
                of the charity, need of the beneficiaries and its urgency.
              </li>
              <li>
                Priority will be given to charities that:

                    Support serving and veteran RAF personnel and their
                    dependents in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health,
                    disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Educate the public (and particularly young people) on the
                    subjects of the RAF, other air forces and their spheres of
                    operation
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Aid communities and charitable interests closely associated

                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
