        The Red Arrows Trust provides grants to fund projects and activities
        carried out by other charities. During an average year, this amounts to
        over Â£100,000.
      </p>
      <p>
        We invite applications from organisations that are recognised as
        charitable by the Charity Commission for England and Wales, the Office
        of the Scottish Charity Regulator (OSCR), or the Charity Commission for
        Northern Ireland.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an award is made, all grant recipients must submit a progress report
        and a copy of the charity's latest accounts for each year that funding
        is given. The Trustees may request additional evidence (such as a post
        award visit) to ensure funding is being used appropriately.
